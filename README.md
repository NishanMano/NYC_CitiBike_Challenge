## Overview 

We pulled data from NYC Citibike data from August 2019 and wanted to use this information to encourage potential investors in opening up a new Citibike location in another city Des Moines, Iowa. We used Tableau Public, Jupyter Notebook, and Python in order to create visualizations. The visualizations were used to create the various diagrams and graphs such as:

1. Comparison of Male vs. Female Riders in 24-hour period (Bar Graph)
2. Comparison of User Trips by Gender in a 7-day period (Heat Map) 
3. Comparison of Checkout Time for Users by Hours (Line Graph) 
4. Comparison of Trips by Gender by Weekday per Hour (Heat Map) 
5. Comparison of Trips by Weekday (Heat Map) 
6. Comparison of Starting Locations (Map) 
7. Graph of August Peak Hours (Bar Graph) 

## Tableau Story

#### Comparison of Male vs. Female Riders in 24-hour period (Bar Graph)

The image above shows that we have a lot more male riders than female riders. We can use this information to further investigate why this might be the case. This can also lead to potential insights on advertisement possibilities.

#### Comparison of User Trips by Gender in a 7-day period (Heat Map)
-----
![Image 2](https://i.ibb.co/Yb0q0C9/3.png) 

We see that for both genders Thursday is the most popular day. We would want to avoid repairing any bikes on this day and/or would want to make sure all the bikes are working properly before Thursday. This way we would not lose out on any potential sales.

#### Comparison of Checkout Time for Users by Hours (Line Graph)
-----

The above graph indicates that these bikes are not intended for lengthy bike rides rather it is more for quick commutes. My belief is that if cyclists wanted to use bikes for more than 2 hours they would purchase their own bikes as it may be more cost-efficient. The interesting detail from this graph is that 146 752 riders use the bike solely for 5 minutes. This may be much easier for commuters to get around the city rather than driving a car through congested traffic.

#### Comparison of Trips by Gender by Weekday per Hour (Heat Map) 
-----
![Image 4](https://i.ibb.co/x7Cyqwv/5.png)

This image provides a strong indication that the peak hours of riders of both genders are 8 a.m. in the morning as well as 5 p.m. & 6 p.m. in the evening throughout weekdays. In my opinion, this strongly indicates that the Citibikes are mainly used for commutes to and back from work.

#### Comparison of Trips by Weekday (Heat Map)
-----
![Image 5](https://i.ibb.co/fYH4FTp/6.png)

Similar to the Heat Map above this one, we have very similar results. One thing that is notable is that Thursdays at 6 p.m. we have our highest number of Citibike users which is a total of 44,905 trips. We can also see that on weekends the usage is mainly throughout the middle of the day which is the opposite of a working day.

#### Comparison of Starting Locations (Map)
-----

This image shows the map of New York City. The Manhattan area has a lot more Citibike usage and one possibility for this could be due to the high tourism rate in that specific area. This can be used as an insight to have more readily accessible bikes at the new location we are looking to start up.

The bar chart indicates that we should be fixing/repairing bikes in the early morning hours(1 a.m. - 4 a.m.) mainly because the bikes are rarely used at this point. We would want to have technicians hired at these hours to maximize efficiency and to reduce any potential sales lost. 

## Summary: 
As indicated through many of the visuals shown above male riders were the primary user during the period of August 2019. We also noticed that if we have more Citibikes placed in high tourist areas we can greatly increase our revenue. Those bikes tend to start and stay in relatively the same location which could indicate that it is primarily used for recreational and/or tourist trips. The majority of the trips were conducted for a maximum of 5 minutes which could mean that if we set up Citibikes in highly congested areas we could earn more and reduce environmental pollution. This could be advertised as a green solution for areas with high traffic and it can also reduce the number of idle vehicles on the road. 

One possible future visualization is that we take a look at the population sizes of the two cities.  Currently, as of the year, 2022, Des Moines, Iowa is close to 552,000. New York City's population size is currently close to 8,804,000. We would essentially scale down the number of Citibikes in proportion to the population difference. This could also mean that there would be fewer Citibikes offered in the outskirts of the downtown core. They should also look for specific areas where there is a lot of traffic in Des Moines, Iowa, and consider whether it would be a good idea to invest in Citibikes in such places. 

Another possible future visualizations that we could look at are the difference in riders in different seasons of the year. This would allow for us to not over-estimate simply looking off at a summer month. An investor would want to have all data and not just the best-case scenario. Another
